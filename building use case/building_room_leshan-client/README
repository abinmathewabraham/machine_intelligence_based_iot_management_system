- This is a copy of the official Leshan Client Demo.
- The Project contains code to simulate fire sensor and sprinkler.
- Fire sensor is modelled as Generic Sensor Object and Sprinkler is modelled as Actuation Object.
- f/F toggles the fire sensor state
- s/S toggles the Sprinkler actuation state

Procedures to build this server:-
1) Download the Leshan project from Github.
2) Paste this project folder into leshan-master/leshan/.
3) Do 'mvn clean install' as instructed in leshan repository
	- This will create the necessary jar files which will be used in the next step
4) Do 'mvn clean install' inside the project folder.
	- The jar files will be created in the target folder

To Run:-
	java -jar building_room_leshan-client/target/room-client-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
		- command line arguments can be given. (For example -n RoomAClient will set the Endpoint as RoomAClient)
		- run it in different shells and create corresponding room clients.
			- The endpoint names should be different
